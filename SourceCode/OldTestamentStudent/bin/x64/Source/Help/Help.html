    <h1><a id="mozTocId711717" class="mozTocH1"></a>Hebrew Bible Student - Help</h1>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId790521" class="mozTocH3"></a>1 General Information about
      Old Testament Student (OTS) </h3>
    The aim of Old Testament Student (OTS) is to provide you with a version of
    the Old Testament in its original languages, with some tools for exploring
    it <span style="font-style: italic;">on your own computer</span>, This
    means that you can use it even when the internet is not available. It also
    means that you can work at your computer's speed and not that of your
    internet connection. (Please see the final section, <span style="font-style: italic;">Caveats
      and Compliments</span>, for a brief explanation of sources and
    acknowledgements.) <br>
    <br>
    We'll introduce you to the different parts of the application in detail
    later but let's get an overview now of what Bible Reader offers. It provides<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The text of the Old Testament as provided by Biblia Hebraica
        Stuttgartensia, displayed for a selected chapter;</li>
      <li>Alternatively, you can read Rhalfs edition of the Septuagint (the
        Greek translation of the Old Testament, made around 200 BC); </li>
      <li>A parse window: simply by clicking and "Analysing" a word, you can get
        a grammatical analysis of that word;</li>
      <li>At the same time, it will also try to give you details of how the word
        was used, as provided by the BDB (Brown, Driver and Briggs) lexicon for
        the Hebrew and Aramaic or Liddell &amp; Scott for the Greek;</li>
      <li>A search facility allows you to get a list of all the verse where the
        word is used, together with some additional sophisitcation in search
        criteria;</li>
      <li>A notes area: a feature that allows you to create, save and restore
        notes for each verse.</li>
    </ul>
    So, let's look at the application in more detail.<br>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId278659"></a>2. A Brief Overview of
      what you see </h3>
    When you first start the application, it will look something like this:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="01%20Opening%20Window.png" alt="Opening Window"

        height="893" width="1186"></div>
    <br>
    Let's initially describe the different parts of this window in general
    terms. There is a panel at the top of the window which we will call the
    Orientation Panel. In the schematic image below, this is the area shaded in
    green.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="02%20Application%20Areas.png" alt="Application Areas"

        height="893" width="1186"></div>
    <br>
    This area is mainly to do with navigating to the desired chapter and book.<br>
    <br>
    The rest of the window is divided into two areas: the left panel (shaded
    red) and the right panels (shaded blue).&nbsp; We've seperated out the
    bottom panel (in yellow) because this adds the ability to display virtual
    keyboards (Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek) for input to the Search facility and
    the notes. <br>
    <br>
    The left panel will display the actual text and is, in reality, the heart of
    the application. The right panels are a variety of sub-sections that are
    mainly to do with presenting information that you ask for as you work on the
    text.<br>
    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId193419"></a>2.1 The Orientation Panel</h4>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="03%20Orientation%20Panel.png" alt="Orientation Panel"

        height="343" width="710"></div>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="04 Additional Orientation.png" alt="Additional" width="611" height="266"></div>
    <br>
    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId494456"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>2.2
      The left (Text) Pane</h4>
    <p>The left text pane contains the text itself (the main point of the
      application), and (in the section shown in yellow, above) a list of
      references recently visited and the ability to produce a "virtual
      keyboard" (see later). This is a good time to emphasise that the same is
      available independantly for both the text of the BHS (which we generally
      refer to as "MT" for "Masoretic Text") and the text of the Septuagint
      (LXX).</p>
    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId505599"></a>2.3 The Right
      (Information) Area</h4>
    <br>
    <table style="text-align: left; width: 1213px; height: 690px;" cellspacing="2"

      cellpadding="2" border="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img src="06%20Information%20Area.png"

              alt="Information Area" height="778" width="600"></td>
          <td style="vertical-align: middle; text-align: left;">The upper half
            of the pane contains a variety of panels that will provide the user
            with:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>An area in which parse information for a selected word can be
                displayed (Grammatical information);</li>
              <li>An area where one or more possible Lexical entries for the
                word are displayed (Lexical Information);</li>
              <li>An area in which any search results are displayed.</li>
            </ul>
            &nbsp;We will discuss each of these in more detail below.<br>
            <br>
            The bottom half is quite busy and varies slightly, depending whether
            you are looking at the MT or LXX:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>An area in which you can record notes attached to a specific
                verse;</li>
              <li>An area to set up details for a search (where the results are
                displayed in the Search Results pane in the top half);</li>
              <li>when looking at the MT, you can also show both the Kethib and
                the Qere, where relevant;</li>
              <li>when looking at the LXX, this area includes information that
                may help decode some of the abbreviations used in the Liddell
                &amp; Scott lexicon entries. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId455626"></a>3 The main Text Area</h3>
    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId393877"></a>3.1 The Basics </h4>
    It's pretty obvious what happens here:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 557px; height: 301px;" alt="Navigating the Main Text Area"

        title="Navigating the Main Text Area" src="07%20Navigating%20the%20Main%20Text%20Area.jpg"></div>
    <br>
    You can change the book you are reading by selecting from the list in the
    Book list, in the Orientation Panel. Similarly, you can change the chapter
    alone by selecting from the Chapter list. Note that, if you change the <span

      style="font-style: italic;">book</span>, it will automatically reset to
    the first chapter of that book.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 765px; height: 415px;" alt="Managing the Text"

        title="Managing the Text" src="08%20Managing%20the%20text.JPG"></div>
    <br>
    You can also select a specific verse from the relevant pull-down list but
    there will be no visible change.<br>
    <br>
    If you have a note displayed for your current verse and you change this
    verse reference, that note will disappear from view. (Don't worry! It will
    be saved.) Similarly, if the verse you change to already has a note, then
    this note will now be displayed. We'll talk about the purpose of the list of
    verses and about notes later. <br>
    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId250846"></a>3.2 Some Additional
      Options</h4>
    If you right click anywhere on the text area, a small menu will pop up:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="09%20Further%20menu%20options.png"

        alt="09 Further menu options" height="668" width="627"></div>
    <p><br>
      The first four options open a mini-window known as a "dialog" (spelt the
      American way):</p>
    <p align="center"> <img src="09b%20Copy%20Options%20dialog.png" alt="Copy Options dialog"

        height="226" width="676"></p>
    <p align="left">Whether you are copying a single word, a verse or the whole
      chapter, you will get the same dialog of options. This will allow you to
      specify:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>whether the target destination of the copy is memory or the relevant
        Notes page;</li>
      <li>whether to include the reference in the copy or not;</li>
      <li>whether to remove accents or not.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also check the box to ensure that the options you select are
      remembered. This will mean that future copies will automatically use the
      same options. Note, however, that</p>
    <ul>
      <li>each copy option is treated separately (so, even if you check the box
        to remember the selected options for copying a word, you <em>will</em>
        be prompted with the same dialog on copying a verse);</li>
      <li>the selected options are specific to the language you are currently
        using (so, if you change to the other language, you will also get fresh
        prompts). </li>
    </ul>
    <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId664164"></a>3.2.1 Copy Current Word,
      Verse or Chapter to ...</h5>
    <p>This will do what the image tells you.<br>
      <br>
      If you select Memory, this will copy the currently selected word into
      memory (technically, into the "Clipboard"). This means that you can paste
      it into another application, such as a Word Processor. (If you're not sure
      how to paste into your application, check its help facility, look on
      Google or ask a friend.) The option to omit accents allows you to copy a
      clearer version of the text, not hampered by the complex accenting system
      of Hebrew.<br>
      <br>
      If you select Notes, it will copy the word to the notes area for the
      current verse <span style="font-style: italic;">at the point where your
        cursor is currently positioned</span>.<br>
      <br>
      When you right click to get the Context Menu, make sure that the mouse is
      over the specific result and word that you are interested in.<br>
      <br>
      Be aware that the concept of a word in most European languages needs a
      degree of refinement in Hebrew.&nbsp; We normally think of a word as a
      sequence of letters (or some kind of more precise equivalent) seperated
      from others by spaces and/or grammatical symbols.&nbsp; It's not that easy
      in Hebrew.&nbsp; Consider Genesis 25:2 and the "word":</p>
    <h1 align="center"><a id="mozTocId268133" class="mozTocH1"></a>&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1428;&#1503;
  </h1>
    <p>There are two obvious components to this word: the "main" word, <big><big>&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1503;,</big></big>
      a masculine noun which is, in fact, a man's name, and the component to the
      right of the mappeq.&nbsp; But that's not all, this second element can be
      sub-divided into the preposition, <big><big>&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;,</big></big> and the
      conjunction, <big><big>&#1493;</big></big>&#1456;.&nbsp; Are these individual words
      or something else that only become words when used in certain ways?&nbsp;
      Well, for better or worse, they are divided into word-like units in HBS,
      so be careful where you place your mouse when you open this pop-up menu.<br>
      <br>
      If you are using Windows 10 or later, be aware that it keeps a record of
      snippets that you have copied to the clipboard.&nbsp; So, if you hold down
      the Windows key, <img style="width: 40px; height: 40px;" alt="Windows Key"

        title="Windows Key" src="10%20Windows%20Key.jpg" align="middle" hspace="2">,
      and then tap <span style="font-style: italic;">V</span> you will be
      presented with a list of recently copied items.&nbsp; You will be able to
      select any one of these to paste into your target application.&nbsp; This
      makes the copy-paste approach more flexible. </p>
    <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId510541"></a>3.2.2 Copy Selected Text
      to ... </h5>
    <p>You can select a small amount of text by using a click and drag
      technique: click the left mouse of the button, as normal, at the place
      where you want to selection to start but hold the button down rather than
      letting go; then, while holding the button down, drag the mouse until it
      is over the place where you want the selection to finish; then let go.
      Once you have done this, you can right click anywhere in the text area and
      select the menu option to copy the selected text. Note that you can also
      perform this task by double-clicking, which will select a whole word, and
      then dragging to select additional words.&nbsp; (Bear in mind, though, the
      comments earlier on what is a word.)<br>
      <br>
      Note that you will be presented with the same dialog and the same options
      as other copy actions. </p>

    <h5><a id="mozTocId13561" class="mozTocH5"></a>3.2.5 Kethib-Qere option</h5>
    <p>In the passages that we have shown so far, there were no Kethib/Qere
      readings. (As a reminder, there are some words that, for various reasons,
      ancient Hebrew scholars questioned. Because the text was sacred, they
      stopped short of actually changing the main text so, to indicate that they
      think it should be read differently, they wrote consonants of the old word
      (the Kethib) but pointed it with the vowels of the new word (the Qere).
      Our text always presents the Qere form but, by default, displays the word
      in red. If you right click on one of these words, an extra option will
      appear in the context menu:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="9d%20Kethib-Qere%20option.png" alt="9d Kethib-Qere option"

        height="219" width="451"></p>
    <p>This will display both the Kethib and the Qere in the lower area on the
      right:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="9e%20Kethib-Qere%20display.png" alt="9e Kethib-Qere display"

        height="319" width="653"></p>
    <p>(Note: the spelling of "Kethib" and "Qere" varies in different sources.)

    <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId899478"></a>3.2.6 Analyse Word</h5>
    See section 4 below for more about this. <br>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId799897"></a>4 Analysis</h3>
    This is a convenient diescription for the action of creating:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Parse details, and</li>
      <li>Lexical information for the selected word.</li>
    </ol>
    If you right click on a word in the text area, you will see a small context
    menu pop up.&nbsp; Then select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Analyse
      Word</span> option from the resulting pop-up menu to obtain parsing
    details and lexical information for that word. You will see the parsing
    information on the right hand, top pane immediately:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 1048px; height: 331px;"

        alt="Parsing a Word" title="Parsing a Word" src="11%20Parsing%20a%20word.JPG"></div>
    <br>
    We have selected the word to be analysed so that you can compare the final
    result with where we started.&nbsp; You do not need to do this to perform an
    analysis: a simple right click will suffice.<br>
    <br>
    Note that our earlier comments on the nature of words applies here.&nbsp;
    We've deliberately chosen a word that contains a main lexical item, a
    preposition and the standard conjunction.&nbsp; Each are treated seperately
    by OTS.<br>
    <br>
    We need to provide a caveat that applies to all elements of OTS.&nbsp; This
    parsing information has been provided in the source data and we cannot
    guarantee its accuracy.&nbsp; It may provide you a clue when you find a word
    difficult but this tool does not absolve you from the need of understanding
    your Hebrew (or Aramaic) grammar and reflecting critically on the text you
    are reading.&nbsp; We are not responsible for you failing you PhD because
    you accepted our parse or lexical information too readily.<br>
    <br>
    To see the dictionary definition, click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lexical
      Information</span> tab:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 1063px; height: 348px;"

        alt="Lexical Information" title="Lexical Information" src="12%20Lexical%20information.JPG"></div>
    <br>
    These are actually "candidate entries" in BDB for the selected word.&nbsp;
    OTS uses a somewhat tortuous method to identify the potential BDB entry
    which requires a number of caveats.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>They are based, to a large extent, on entries in Strong's Concordance
        which is generally considered to be somewhat unreliable in academic
        circles;</li>
      <li>The selection method often results in multiple possible entries, so <span

          style="font-style: italic;">all</span> have been given;</li>
      <li>We may simply have got the link wrong.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The upshot of these caveats is that using OTS does not absolve you from
      the need to exercise your own critical facilities.&nbsp; Where there are
      multiple entries, you will need to select the one you think is
      correct.&nbsp; In all cases, you will also need to assure yourself that
      this meaning is correct.&nbsp; (Even if you use BDB in the traditional
      way, or are a devotee of Koehler &amp; Baumgartner, the need to be
      critical in your use of their studies also applies.)<br>
      <br>
      Note that parse details and lexical information will remain available
      until you request a new analysis and that changing tabs does not erase
      data.</p>
    <p>Analysing Greek words occurs in much the same way (except, of course, a
      different lexicon is used). It should be noted that the source data
      sometimes identified a base form for some words that were not considered
      as base forms by Liddell and Scott. A good example of this is words that
      are only found as deponents in the LXX and, so, the base form would be
      -&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;. If the active form is found in classical or wider Greek, Liddell
      &amp; Scott may have entered this under its active form (e.g. -&#969;). We have
      tried to build a number of strategies into the search process but we
      cannot guarantee that all words will be identified.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId1136"></a>5 History</h3>
    Old Testament Student keeps a track of passages you have previously
    selected. If you want to return to a previous Book and Chapter, simply click
    on the little down arrow of the relevant History Combo Box:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 549px; height: 490px;" alt="History"

        title="History" src="13%20History.jpg"></div>
    <br>
    Then select the previously-used passage that you want and the application
    will reset the main text to that chapter.<br>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId718857"></a>6. Searching</h3>
    If you click on the Search tab in the lower right pane, you will find a
    fairly busy pane which allows you to configure a search:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 619px; height: 323px;" alt="The Search Panel"

        title="The Search Panel" src="14%20The%20Search%20panel.JPG"></div>
    <br>
    This will take quite a bit of unpacking and some time to get used to, but it
    is to be hoped that this will be an important part of OTS. <br>
    <br>
    Obviously, the word to search for must be entered into the first textbox:
    Search for the word. The question is: How do you type a Hebrew word into the
    box?<br>
    <br>
    Probably the most useful mechanism requires a return to the text area. If
    you right click on a word in the text area, a context menu option allows you
    to copy that word into this box:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 615px; height: 477px;" alt="From Main Text"

        title="From Main Text" src="15%20From%20Main%20Text.jpg"></div>
    <div align="center"><br>
      If you select this menu option it will insert the selected word into the
      box.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="16%20Resulting%20input.png" alt="16 Resulting input" height="565"

        width="1277"> <br>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
      So, with the word in the textbox, simply click on the Perform Search
      button and OTS will look for all the occurrences in the OT:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="17%20Search%20Results.png" alt="17 Search Results"

          height="585" width="647"></div>
      <p><br>
        Notice the scroll bar to the right of the search results. This means that
      you can click on the light grey area below the "thumb" and scroll down a
      page for more results. Alternatively, you can "drag" the darker grey thumb
      (the small square) and drag down as much or as little as you want.<br>
      <br>
      Notice also the message at the bottom of the results. This was created
      while it was performing the search and is a report on progress. For searches involving frequently used words, the progress of the search is made visible here:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="17b Search Results visible.png" alt="17b Search Results visible" width="803" height="557"></p>
      <p>Be
        patient: the application is scanning through a lot of text and can take a
        little while.</p>
      <p>Note also that a button has appeared above the Search Results entitled <strong>Stop Current Search</strong>. Clicking on this button will stop the search immediately but any matches found up to that point will remain visible.  </p>
      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId727810"></a>6.1 Being selective
        about which books to search</h4>
      You can speed up the search if you exclude some books from the search
      criteria. This can be done in a number of ways:<br>
      <br>
      a) <span style="font-style: italic;">Specific books</span><br>
      <br>
      If you click on one of the books in the listbox, it will be highlighted
      (or "selected"). If you click on a second book, that too will be selected
      and the first one will stay highlighted. You can scroll through the list
      of books and select specific ones:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 251px; height: 226px;"

          alt="Selecting specific books" title="Selecting specific books" src="18%20Selecting%20specific%20books.JPG"></div>
      <br>
      If we now click on the Remove Selected Books, GBS will remove those books
      from the search criteria:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 250px; height: 219px;"

          alt="Specific books gone" title="Specific books gone" src="19%20Specific%20books%20gone.JPG"></div>
      <br>
      Look carefully and you will see that the three selected books are no
      longer in the list. Incidentally, if you clicked on a book in error and it
      was selected, simply click on it again and it will be un-selected,<br>
      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId52332"></a>6.2 Excluding and
        including whole collections of books</h4>
      If I want to exclude whole groups of books, I can use the check boxes to
      the right of the book list. Imagine, for example, that I don't want to
      search the books of Moses. Then, I can simply click on the checkbox, <span

        style="font-weight: bold;">Pentateuch</span> and they will disappear
      from the list:<br>
      <br>
      <table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"

        border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: right;"><img style="width: 250px; height: 226px;"

                alt="The book list" title="The book list" src="20%20The%20book%20list.JPG"></td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img style="width: 248px; height: 216px;"

                alt="Moses has gone" title="Moses has gone" src="21%20Moses%20has%20gone.JPG"></td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </td> </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><br>
        Note that the list of available books is different in the LXX. In
        particular, a number of additional books are included (which are
        generally considered as pseudo-canonical or apocryphal by Protestants).
        Some canonical books also occur under different names and the order of
        chapters and verses may also vary. </p>
      <p>You may have noticed the two buttons above the book list: one says
        Exclude and the other says Include. These are "radio buttons": clicking
        on one un-clicks the other; they are an either/or choice. If you select
        <strong>use (the listed books)</strong>, then any books showing in the
        listbox will be included in the final search. On the other hand, if you
        select <strong>Ignore (the listed books)</strong>, then only the books
        <em>not</em> in the listbox will be included in the search . At any
        time, if you click on <strong>Reinstate Books to default settings<em>,</em></strong>
        <em>all</em> the books will reappear.&nbsp; So, using these simple
        selection tools, you can quickly and easily narrow your search criteria.
      </p>
      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId296468"></a>6.3 A second way of
        entering your search word</h4>
      In general, I have found the method described above as the most common
      method by far. However, there is a second way. If you look on the bottom
      left of the application window (in the yellow area), you will see the
      button: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Keyboard</span>.&nbsp;
      Click on this button and a virtual keyboard will be revealed:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 654px; height: 388px;"

          alt="The Virtual Keyboard" title="The Virtual Keyboard" src="22%20The%20Virtual%20Keyboard.jpg"></div>
      <p><br>
        The radio buttons under the keyboard will determine where any word you
        type will go. The main benefit of this keyboard is that you can easily
        enter Hebrew text into your notes. However, you can also use this to
        populate your search option by selecting the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Primary
          Search Word</span> radio button option. Now, when you type, the
        characters will be entered in the Search textbox.<br>
        <br>
        Of course, you "type" using the mouse. These do not respond to keyboard
        presses. To get the vowels or sin/shin dot, click on the relevant
        consonant first, then on the special character. If the addition is not
        allowed, it will simply be ignored. <br>
        <br>
        You may need to experiment with this option a little. You will also need
        to be careful that you have typed the word exactly.</p>
      <p>We have shown the Hebrew/Aramaic keyboard but a similarly provided
        Greek virtua; keyboard is provided when in the LXX section.</p>
      <p><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId479136"></a>6.4 Secondary Search
        Criteria</p>
      No doubt the hawk-eyed user has already noted several references to <span

        style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary Searches</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary
        Search Words</span> You can either redirect a second typed word by
      selecting the Secondary Search String radio button option on the virtual
      keyboard, or you can use another search option when you right click on a
      selected word in the text:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="23%20Secondary%20Selection.png"

          alt="23 Secondary Selection" height="483" width="1277"></div>
      <br>
      This will then modify the search area:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="24%20Resulting%20Secondary%20Entry.png"

          alt="24 Resulting Secondary Entry" height="525" width="1284"></div>
      <br>
      When you click on Perform Search you will now search for all occurrences
      of the primary word that occur within n words of the secondary word: <br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="25%20Secondary%20Search%20Result.png"

          alt="25 Secondary Search Result" height="780" width="654"></div>
      <p><br>
        You will need to be very patient when using this option: the search
        process is a lot more complex and can take quite some time.</p>
      <p> You can vary the strictness or slackness of criteria by varying the
        "distance" of the two words, up to a separation of 10 words. It will be
        for you to judge how far the two words can be apart before their mutual
        occurrence becomes coincidental rather than significant.&nbsp; Remember
        also that "word" means something a little different: two main words
        "next to each other" might actually be three or four words apart.&nbsp;
        If you are searching for two related words and one is much less frequent
        generally than the other, we recommend that you make the less frequent
        word the Primary Word.&nbsp; That should speed the search somewhat.</p>
      <p>In the example shown above, we have changed the search words to ensure
        that we get a number of matches.</p>
      <p>Note that some matches are separated by a dark line and some are not.
        Where there is no dark line, we have found natches <em>between</em> two
        verses - the two verses without a dark line separating them. Some will
        have multiple matches, so look carefully.</p>
      <p> Note, then, that this search can return matches across two or even
        three verses.</p>
      <h4><a id="mozTocId359833" class="mozTocH4"></a>6.5 Different types of
        search</h4>
      <p>You will have noticed that, beneath the primary (and secondary) word,
        there is an option to select one of three strategies for matching words:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Matching BDB references;</li>
        <li>Matching the exact form of the selected word (but ignoring accents);</li>
        <li>Matching the exact <em>consonants</em> of the selected word.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These will need a little additional explanation.</p>
      <h5><a id="mozTocId348969" class="mozTocH5"></a>6.5.1 Matching BDB
        references</h5>
      <p>We have already explained that the source data provides us with one or
        more BDB references for most words, which has allowed us to identify
        potential meaning (lexical entries) for words. This option will find
        other occurrences of words with one or more of the same BDB references.
        Note that, since some of these references are tangential links, it may
        create "matches" that are somewhat tenuous. Equally, it may create
        matches that you might not expect and they could be quite fruitful. As
        with much of the application, this is an aid and doesn't replace the
        need for you to exercise reason and caution.</p>
      <h5><a id="mozTocId113964" class="mozTocH5"></a>6.5.2 Matching the exact
        form</h5>
      <p>This is the strictest of the three options. This means that a search
        for <font size="+2">&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</font> (for example, from Gen 9<sup>26</sup>)
        will not match <font size="+2">&#1497;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;</font> in Gen 10<sup>9</sup>,
        because the two word forms have different vowels. </p>
      <h5><a id="mozTocId14274" class="mozTocH5"></a>6.5.3 Matching consonants
        but not vowels (or accents)</h5>
      <p>This is a kind of compromise between the very loose match criteria of
        the first option and the tight criteria of the second. In this case, the
        two forms of the verb <em>would</em> be matched but a second person
        form would still be excluded. </p>
      <h5><a id="mozTocId965739" class="mozTocH5"></a>6.5.4 Greek Matching
        options</h5>
      <p>In Greek searches, the equivalent function is a little simpler. Here,
        you can either</p>
      <ul>
        <li>match on base (lexical) forms - referred to as "roots" but they are
          not normally true roots, or </li>
        <li>identical matches (although accents are ignored). </li>
      </ul>
      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId739149"></a>6.6 Using the Search
        Results</h4>
      These search results are primarily for your information. They form a kind
      of concordance. However, you can also make use of them. Right click on any
      specific result and you will see the following Context Menu: <br>

      the search results or just the specifically selected result to either
      memory or to the currently active notes area.&nbsp; These two destinations
      work in much the same way as §3.2 above.&nbsp; Remember that, if you copy
      it to the notes area, it will be active in the note for the currently
      selected verse.<br>

        Selected Chapter</h5>
      Again, you need to be careful where you click for this option. It will
      change the book and chapter in the left (Text) pane to that of the result.
      So, for example, if you select this option on the result for Genesis
      18:10, it will change the text presented in the left pane to Genesis 18. <br>
      <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId435214"></a>7. Notes</h3>
      This is the first tab in the area at the bottom right of the window.&nbsp;
      This is an area where you can simply make notes about a given verse. Each
      verse has its own notes area and, when you change to a different verse
      (whether in the same chapter or elsewhere), the note will disappear and,
      if the new destination already has a note, the new note will appear. So,
      if you change something and the note disappears, don't be too worried:
      moving back to the original verse should restore the note as well.<br>
      <br>
      We will learn more about notes in section 9.2 below. <br>
      <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId316927"></a>8. The Main Menu - File
        option</h3>
      The main menu is found at the top of the application window, in the
      Orientation Panel:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 346px; height: 228px;"

          alt="Main Menu - file option" title="Main Menu - file option" src="27%20Main%20Menu%20-%20file%20option.jpg"></div>
      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId642411"></a>8.1 Preferences</h4>
      Clicking on this option will open a new mini-window (known as a dialog -
      note American spelling):<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="28%20Preferences%20Dialog.png"

          alt="28 Preferences Dialog" height="453" width="994"></div>
      <p><br>
        Each tab along the top of this dialog represents one of the areas in
        which text occurs and which can be modified.</p>
      <p>Within each main tab are additional tabs. These are effectively, one
        tab for each configurable element of text. (In addition, the background
        colour can be changed in the first tab of each area.) &nbsp;&nbsp; The
        textbox below shows what the relevant area currently looks like and, as
        you change parameters, these changes will be reflected in the textbox:<br>
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="29%20Preferences%20Dialog%20Example.png"

          alt="29 Preferences Dialog Example" height="453" width="994"></div>
      <br>
      We have made some changes to the main text area in the image above purely
      as an example.&nbsp; In this case we have:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>increased the size of the verse numbers to 22 points;</li>
        <li>changed the text colour of the verse numbers to yellow, and</li>
        <li>changed the background colour to red.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is no problem in experimenting with colours and sizes: none of
        the changes you have made will take effect until you click on the <span

          style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> button - and, if you select <span

          style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</span>, all the changes will be
        ignored.</p>
      <p>If you compare the image above with the one before it, you will notice that a button has been added beside the text, &quot;Restore all colours and font metrics:&quot;. This will appear if any changes have been made. Clicking on this will restore all colours and font settings to those that applied at the start of the dialog <em>for that text area</em> alone.  <br>
        <br>
        What changes can you make?<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Main MT Text Area:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Background colour;</li>

      </ul>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Word

      <p>We have had to display the BDB lexical data as HTML and, as a result,
        are not currently able to modify sizes or colours.</p>
      <p>For Greek lexical data you can change:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Background colour;</li>
        <li>Size, font and style of the main, parse text and headings
          independantly;</li>
        <li>Colour of both of the text types independantly </li>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Search Results Areas:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Background colour;</li>

        <li>Size, font and style of the text;</li>
        <li>Colour of the text </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why change colours and text </strong></p>
      <p>This might seem a little unnecessary but some people find
        black-on-white uncomfortable and changing colours may make it easy to
        use the application for long periods of time. (There is some suggestion
        that symptoms of dyslexia are eased when changing colours.) </p>
      <p>In addition, here are some suggested reasons why some might find it
        useful:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As a person of more mature years, the ability to increase text size
          might havesignificant benefits;</li>
        <li>Changing colours or replacing colour differentiation by, e.g., use
          of italics and bold might help people who have difficulty in
          distinguishing certain colours;</li>
        <li>Having different background colours might help emphasise the
          different areas of the application. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Remember, none of the changes are actually activated until you click
        on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> button.</p>
      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId39681"></a>8.2 Managing Notes</h4>
      We've talked about the notes but we need to look at additional facilities
      that are provided in managing notes.<br>
      <br>
      Each verse can have a note attached to it. We collect all the notes
      together to form a Note Set. HBS allows you to have more than one Note Set
      but you can only have one Note Set active at any one time.<br>
      <br>
      Out of the box, HBS comes with a single Note Set called default.
      Additional menu options under the Manage Notes option allows you modify
      your use of notes:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 554px; height: 273px;"

          alt="Main menu - Notes" title="Main menu - Notes" src="31%20Main%20menu%20-%20Notes.jpg"></div>
      <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId726587"></a>8.2.1 Create a New Note
        Set</h5>
      <br>
      Selecting this option will open a dialog to allow you to create a new Note
      Set:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 421px; height: 173px;"

          alt="New Note Set" title="New Note Set" src="32%20New%20Note%20Set.JPG"></div>
      <br>
      You'll see that I've given the new Note Set a name. All I now have to do
      is OK it.<br>
      <br>
      This not only creates the new Note Set but changes the currently active
      Set to this new one. You can check this out by looking at the tab in the
      bottom right area of the application.<br>
      <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId593665"></a>8.2.2 Choose a different
        Note Set</h5>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 421px; height: 173px;"

          alt="Different Note Set" title="Different Note Set" src="33%20Different%20Note%20Set.JPG"></div>
      <br>
      The currently active Note Set is lower down the dialog, in red. The
      listbox gives you a list of all other Note Sets that are available.
      (Notice that we have created an additional one called <span style="font-weight: bold;">Another
        Test</span>.) Select the one you want and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span>
      and your Note Set will be changed.<br>
      <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId612667"></a>8.2.3 Delete an existing
        Note Set</h5>
      This is a logical complement to the other tasks and functions pretty much
      as you'd expect:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 421px; height: 173px;"

          alt="Delete a Note Set" title="Delete a Note Set" src="34%20Delete%20a%20Note%20Set.JPG"><br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">Note that the current Note Set is not
          included in the list that can be deleted. If you want to delete the
          current set, you must change to another Set first. The logical
          consequence of this is that you must always have at least one Note Set
          within HBS. (If you are enterprising and manage to delete all note
          sets outside the application, HBS will create a new, empty Note Set
          called <span style="font-weight: bold;">default</span> next time you
          run the application.<br>
          <br>
          Beware: deleting the note set will destroy any data you have created
          within that set.<br>
          <h5><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId889597"></a>8.2.4 Show the

      <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId182724"></a>10 Additional
        Information about the Main Window</h3>
      10.1 Getting the Window the way you want it<br>
      <br>
      You can resize the window by dragging the window edges or corners in any
      desired direction. We will assume that you are familiar with resizing
      windows (and click-and-drag actions, in particular) and, if you are not,
      we recommend that you read a book on using your operating system.&nbsp;
      The application will remember any changes you make to the size and
      position of the main window and will open it to look the same the next
      time you use OTS.&nbsp; In order to make sure this is the case, we suggest
      that you always use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Close</span>
      button. <br>
      <br>
      The window is divided into two halves and, between the main text area and
      the collection of small panes on the right hand side, there is a Splitter
      Bar. Slowly move your mouse from the main text area across to the right
      and, as you cross the divider, the cursor shape should change. At the
      point the curser has changed you can click and drag the bar with your
      mouse. The benefit of this change is that you can maximise the area in
      which you have main interest.&nbsp; The position of the splitter bar will
      also be remembered between sessions.<br>
      <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId256711"></a>11 Adjusting the
        right-hand Pane</h3>
      The one control on the top tool bar that we haven't discussed is the
      pull-down list on the extreme right:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 330px; height: 218px;"

          alt="Equalise" title="Equalise" src="38%20Equalise.PNG"></div>
      <br>
      The purpose of this feature is to enable you to easily manage the
      information in the various sections on the right-hand side of the
      application. Sometimes you may want to concentrate on information in the
      top panel (e.g. Search Results) and at other times you may want to focus
      on the lower panel (e.g. if creating a complex note). This feature will
      enable you to resize these sub-panels in a controlled fashion.<br>
      <br>
      The options availabel are:<br>
      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId37642"></a>11.1 Minimise Bottom</h4>
      In other words, reduce the bottom panel to an absolute minimum and allow
      you to focus on the top panel. To use this option, simply click on the
      down arrow beside the Resize control and select the Minimise Bottom
      option:<br>
      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId556069"></a>11.2 Minimise Top</h4>
      This has a similar effect but works in the other direction.<br>
      <h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId763988"></a>11.3 Equalise Both</h4>
      This will restore the dividing bar between the two sub-panels to the
      mid-point vertically. This means that both the top and bottom panel on the
      right hand side will be roughly the same size.<br>
      <br>
      You are still able to resize these panels manually by clicking on the
      Splitter Bar and dragging it into the desired position.<br>
      <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId643709"></a>12. Caveats and

        frequent words.<br>
        <br>
        The text used in HBS is based on the work of Eliran Wong, which is
        apparently the basis of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Open

        As has been said above, the lexicon used is that of the BDB (Brown,

      <p>The version of the LXX used seems to have originated from CCAT (which,
        in turn, is based on the Rahlfs text) but some modifications were
        facilitated from a member of a Classical Greek forum and, sadly, we did
        not note his name or details at the time and are unable to make adequate
        acknowledgements. It is with sorrow that we admit this.</p>
      <p>Because the path to the final versions of both MT and LXX have been
