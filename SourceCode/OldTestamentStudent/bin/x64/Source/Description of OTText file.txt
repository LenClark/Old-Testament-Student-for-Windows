Fields:           
======            
                  
1    Global word id    A sequential count of all OT words in book, chapter, verse, occurrence order 
2    Global Verse id   Each verse is allocated a unique integer, in the same order                  
3    Book no.          Int (1 - 39) These are "keys" to Titles.txt in the Source directory          
4    Chapter no.       Int (1 - n)                                                                  
                         Note: real numbers, not sequence.  So                                      
                         a) not 0-based                                                             
                         b) requires a seperate sequence number when processing chapters            
5    Verse no.         Int (1 - n) Similar constraints to field 4                                   
6    Word sequence no. Int (0 - n) (note: zero-based, unlike the other counts)                      
7    Word              String.  This is the word as used in the text                                
                         Note: there are a small number of "words" that are actually multiple words 
                               and contain spaces.  These have been replaced by non-breaking space   
                               (hex 0x00a0) so that a normal space can be used as a boundary value  
                               between words.                                                       
8    Unaccented Word   I.e. the word in field 7 with accents removed but retaining                  
                         a) vowels                                                                  
                         b) sin/shin dots                                                           
                         c) dagesh (forte and line)                                                 
                         d)                                                                         
                         e) any non-breaking spaces embedded in the text                            
9    Bare Word         I.e. the word in field 7 with *all* pointing removed but retaining any       
                         embedded non-breaking spaces                                               
10   Affix             String sequence (if it exists, such as a mappeq) affixed (postfixed) to the  
                         word but not an integral part of the word.                                 
11   Prefix marker     Code to indicate whether the current "word" is seperated from the following  
                         word by a space or not:                                                    
                         1   This word is prefixed to the following word,                           
                         0   A space follows this word                                              
12   Internal code     In the original source data, this was prefixed with "E"                      
13   Strong Reference  The identified Strong reference or references.  In the original data this    
                         was prefixed with "H".                                                     
                         Note that there can be more than one code, in which case subsequent values 
                         are seperated by "+".  (I think this indicates that the word is composed   
                         of more than one Hebrew word and each Strongs code relates to each word.   
14   Gloss             A simple meaning to the word, as provided by Strongs (a bit naive really)    
15   Morphology        I.e. a summarised grammatical analysis. It remains to be seen just how       
                         accurate this summary is
